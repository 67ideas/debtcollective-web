          No. There is no lawsuit that students can join at this time. When student enrolled in Corinthian they signed an arbitration clause, effectively signing away their right to sue in a court of law.

          Don’t get us wrong. Corinthian is facing plenty of legal trouble. If the government agencies win any of their suits against the school, you may get some debt relief. But nothing is certain.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Debt Collective is working with lawyers on a legal strategy called “Defense to Repayment” that you will be able to get involved in soon. Join the Corinthian Collective in order to participate.  As we move forward, we can develop other ways to fight back as well.
