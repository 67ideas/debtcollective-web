<h1>Student debt strike in progress</h1>
<p>
We can’t pay and we won’t pay our debt from Everest College. We demand that the Department of Education discharge our debts and the debts of every current and former student of Corinthian Colleges (Everest, Heald College, and Wyotech).
</p>
<p>
Corinthian defrauded us. It is being sued for running a scam operation to make maximum profits from student loans issued by the Department of Education. Corinthian lied to students like us about the quality of education it offers. Yet, <a href="http://blog.debtcollective.org/students-speak-out-at-doe-hearing-to-demand-debt-cancellation-and-free-education/">when we asked the Department of Education to cancel our Federal loans, they refused to respond</a>.  As campuses are closing or being sold, Corinthian will soon no longer exist.  But its investors will continue to profit because the government has decided that, like the Wall Street banks, it is too big to fail  Their debts are being taken care of, while we are expected to keep on paying ours..  We refuse to do so.
</p>
<p>
By declaring a strike, we fight for all student debtors and for the right to a free, quality education for all students.
