          <h2>The Debt Collective</h2>
          <p>Every month, we are forced into debt for basic necessities. We have no choice but to enter into contracts under unfair terms over which we have little power to bargain or negotiate. Creditors are holding us hostage. When we can’t meet the terms of the contact, we are harassed, we have our wages garnished, and some of us are even imprisoned. The goal of the Debt Collective aims to fight back against creditors and transform how basic necessities, such as education, health care, and housing are provided.

            <h2>Why Join <span>the Debt Collective?</span></h2>
            <p>Creditors profit from the information they have about us. They use this information to confuse and threaten us. We need to untangle the web of confusion. By joining together, we can learn where our money goes and who is profiting from those payments.  By sharing information, we can also learn who stands to lose when we don’t pay. This kind of knowledge could help us work together to renegotiate our payments or even demand the cancellation of illegitimate debts.

          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>
          We’re the people behind the Rolling Jubilee debt cancellation initiative. We operate according to the principle that alone, our debts are a burden, but together, they make us powerful. The Debt Collective is the next step in making that vision a reality. Contact us.

         <h2>What can a debt collective do?</h2>
         <p>
        The goal of the Debt Collective is to create a platform by debtors and for debtors for organization, advocacy, and resistance. Organizing collectively offers many possibilities for building power against creditors:
        </p>
        <p>
        We could organize debtors into groups based on region, type of debt, or institution
        These groups could bargain collectively with creditors or even develop the power to threaten a debt strike.
        A debt collective could also serve as a platform for creating a positive vision of a sustainable economy in which credit would be used to help people instead of destroying lives.
