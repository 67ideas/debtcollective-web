          <h2>The Debt Collective: Organize, Resist, Reimagine</h2>
        </div>

      </div>

    <article>
        <p>Every month, we are forced into debt for basic necessities. We have no choice but to enter into contracts under unfair terms over which we have little power to bargain or negotiate. Creditors are holding us hostage. When we can’t meet the terms of the contact, we are harassed, we have our wages garnished, and some of us are even imprisoned. The goal of the Debt Collective aims to fight back against creditors and transform how basic necessities, such as education, health care, and housing are provided. Alone, our debts are a burden. Together, they make us powerful.</p>

        <h2>Why join a <span>Debt Collective?</span></h2>
        <p>Creditors profit from the information they have about us. They use this information to confuse and threaten us. We need to untangle the web of confusion. By joining together, we can learn where our money goes and who is profiting from those payments.  By sharing information, we can also learn who stands to lose when we don’t pay. This kind of knowledge could help us work together to renegotiate our payments or even demand the cancellation of illegitimate debts.</p>

        <h2>Why do we need the <span>Debt Collective?</span></h2>

        <p>Every month, student debtors, medical debtors, mortgage debtors, and others are asked to make payments with little power to bargain or negotiate. Indebted for life’s basic needs - including education, housing, medical care - debtors have no control over interest rates, repayment policies, credit scores, or the actions of debt collectors. Some have had their wages garnished or been imprisoned for their debts. The goal of the Debt Collective is to change this basic equation by creating and empowering a constituency of debtors for the purpose of organization, advocacy, and resistance.</p>

        <h2>What can a <span>Debt Collective</span> do?</h2>

        <p>The goal of the Debt Collective is to create a platform by debtors and for debtors for organization, advocacy, and resistance. Organizing collectively offers many possibilities for building power against creditors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We could organize debtors into groups based on region, type of debt, or institution</li>
            <li>These groups could bargain collectively with creditors or even develop the power to threaten a debt strike.</li>
            <li>A debt collective could also serve as a platform for creating a positive vision of a sustainable economy in which credit would be used to help people instead of destroying lives.</li>
        </ul>
